# AI-ML-INTERNSHIP-Task 1
Understanding Dataset & Data Types
📌 Task Objective

The objective of this task is to understand the structure, data types, and machine learning readiness of a given dataset. This includes identifying different feature types, analyzing data quality, and determining the suitability of the dataset for machine learning models before any preprocessing or modeling steps.

📊 Datasets Used
This task uses the following publicly available datasets:
Titanic Dataset
Passenger demographic and travel information
Target variable: Survived (Binary classification)
Students Performance Dataset
Academic performance and demographic attributes of students
Used for exploratory understanding of mixed data types

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Version Control: Git & GitHub

🔍 Task Breakdown & Coverage
1. Dataset Loading & Inspection
Loaded datasets using Pandas
Displayed first and last few records to understand structure

2. Data Types Identification
Numerical features (e.g., Age, Fare, Scores)
Categorical features (e.g., Sex, Gender, Race/Ethnicity)
Ordinal features (e.g., Passenger Class, Parental Education)
Binary features (e.g., Survived)

3. Data Structure & Summary
Used df.info() to inspect data types and missing values
Used df.describe() to analyze statistical properties
4. Categorical Distribution Analysis
Checked unique values and class distributions
Identified imbalance in categorical and target variables

5. Target Variable Identification
Clearly defined target and input features
Discussed relevance to classification problems

6. Dataset Size & ML Suitability
Evaluated dataset size and limitations
Discussed risks of underfitting, overfitting, and generalization

7. Data Quality Observations
Presence of missing values
Class imbalance
Need for preprocessing in future tasks

8. Interview-Oriented Conceptual Questions
Numerical vs categorical data
Target variable
Importance of data understanding
Data imbalance
Purpose of df.describe()
